# Description
This repository will hold everything you need to setup the Intersight workflow to provision OpenShift baremetal clusters. 

# Pre requistes
1. An Intersight account
2. 3 or more UCS servers claimed into intersight
3. Intersight premier licenses (90 day trail avaialble)
4. Server Profile Template (example provided)
5. Linux server to host the generated ISO (AWS free tier will suffice, but on-prem is supported through the Intersight Assist.)
6. (optional) create the DNS entries included the PTR records for reverse DNS lookup.

# Steps
1. Create your Policies and Profiles.<br>
Please following the instuctions in [the example directory](examples/README.md) to load the provided example.

3. Login to your Linux server and run the docker container
``` 
docker run -d -p 80:80 baelen/iso-host
```
4. Claim the ISO Host in Intersight as a HTTP target
5. Modify the workflow to use the ISO Host target. <br>

    2. Under External Target click on "Select External Target" and select your ISO_HOST target.
