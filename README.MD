1. An Intersight account
2. 3 or more UCS servers claimed into intersight
3. Intersight premier licenses (90 day trail avaialble)
4. Server Profile Template (example provided)
5. Linux server to host the generated ISO (AWS free tier will suffice, but on-prem is supported through the Intersight Assist.)
6. (optional) create the DNS entries included the PTR records for reverse DNS lookup.

# Steps

Please following the instuctions in [the example directory](examples/README.MD) to load the provided example.

```
3. Claim the ISO Host in Intersight as a HTTP target
4. Import the workflow. After importing the workflow should show as invalid.
5. Modify the workflow to use the ISO Host target. <br>
Open the workflow and go to General -> Workflow Variables.
    1. Behind ISO_HOST click on View Value. 
    2. Click on Select ISO_HOST and select your ISO_HOST target.
    3. Hit Close and then Save. Your workflow should now be valid. 
7. Execute the workflow.
    
# Validated Setup
UCS C220-M5 Rackmount with 2x M.2 drives
If you modify the Server Profile Template this workflow should support other hardware configurations.
